# Installation Types

## Quasar CLI

**App Extension**

:::
#### Install

To add as an App Extension to your Quasar application, run the following (in your Quasar app folder):
```
quasar ext add @quasar/qmarkdown
```

#### Uninstall

To remove as an App Extension from your Quasar application, run the following (in your Quasar app folder):
```
quasar ext remove @quasar/qmarkdown
```

#### Describe
When installed as an App Extension, you can use `quasar describe QMarkdown`
:::

**OR**:

:::
Create and register a boot file:

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import Plugin from '@quasar/quasar-ui-qmarkdown'
import '@quasar/quasar-ui-qmarkdown/dist/index.css'

Vue.use(Plugin)
```
:::

**OR**:

:::
```html
<style src="@quasar/quasar-ui-qmarkdown/dist/index.css"></style>

<script>
import { QMarkdown } from '@quasar/quasar-ui-qmarkdown'

export default {
  components: {
    QMarkdown
  }
}
</script>
```
:::

## Vue CLI project

:::
```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import Plugin from '@quasar/quasar-ui-qmarkdown'
import '@quasar/quasar-ui-qmarkdown/dist/index.css'

Vue.use(Plugin)
```
:::

**OR**:

:::
```html
<style src="@quasar/quasar-ui-qmarkdown/dist/index.css"></style>

<script>
import { QMarkdown } from '@quasar/quasar-ui-qmarkdown'

export default {
  components: {
    QMarkdown
  }
}
</script>
```
:::

## UMD variant

Exports `window.QMarkdown`.

Add the following tag(s) after the Quasar ones:

:::
```html
<head>
  <!-- AFTER the Quasar stylesheet tags: -->
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@quasar/quasar-ui-qmarkdown/dist/index.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- at end of body, AFTER Quasar script(s): -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@quasar/quasar-ui-qmarkdown/dist/index.umd.min.js"></script>
</body>
```
If you need the RTL variant of the CSS, then go for the following (instead of the above stylesheet link):
```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@quasar/quasar-ui-qmarkdown/dist/index.rtl.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```

# Working with markdown
::: tip
When working with markdown, you must always left-justify the content to avoid it being converted to blockquotes or other issues.
:::

There are two way to pass your markdown content to QMarkdown: Vue slot or property.

QMarkdown App Extension also comes with a Webpack loader that allows you to import your markdown directly into your code.

You have the ability to get the TOC (Table of Contents), if one is generated, and display that as well.

## Using the `src` property
It's as simple as:
```html
<q-markdown src=":::\nThis is a **test** of markdown\n:::"></q-markdown>
```
**Output**:

:::
This is a **test** of markdown
:::


## Using a Vue slot
You can simply use a Vue slot to display markdown.

In your HTML:
```html
<q-markdown>
:::
Put your markdown here

Classic markup: :wink: :joy: :cry: :angel: :heart: :beers: :laughing: :yum:

Shortcuts (emoticons): :-) :-( 8-) ;)
:::
</q-markdown>
```
**Output**:

:::
Put your markdown here

Classic markup: :wink: :joy: :cry: :angel: :heart: :beers: :laughing: :yum:

Shortcuts (emoticons): :-) :-( 8-) ;)
:::

A couple of caveats to remember.

Always keep your markdown left justified. It does not have to line up with your HTML. This way, the markdown processor won't process it as a blockquote.

If you start getting weird linting errors, consider a markdown file and importing it.

## Importing Markdown
QMarkdown App Extesnion comes with a Webpack loader for importing markdown files directly into your code.

In your JavaScript:
```js
import markdown from '../markdown/calendar.md'

export default {
  data () {
    return {
      markdown: markdown
    }
  },
...
```

And, in your HTML:
```html
<q-markdown :src="markdown" />
```

Or, alternatively, you can import it in your vue-router `routes.js` file:

```js
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    component: () => import('layouts/MyLayout.vue'),
    children: [
      { path: '', component: () => import('pages/Index.vue') },
      { path: 'contact', component: () => import('pages/contact.vmd') }
    ]
  }
]
```

# Setting up Table of Contents
You enable a TOC by setting `:toc="true"`. The data in the TOC is based on HTML Headings (H1-H6). You can change the number of headings that you are interested in by using the `toc-start` and `toc-end` properties.

To get the data for the TOC, you must use the `@data` event.

HTML
```html
<q-markdown :src="markdown" toc @data="onToc" />
```

JavaScript:
```js
methods: {
  onToc (toc) {
    this.toc = toc
  }
}
```

The TOC data looks like this:
```
[
  {id: 'h2-Heading', label: 'h2 Heading', level: 2, children: []},
  {id: 'h3-Heading', label: 'h3 Heading', level: 3, children: []}
]
```

If you desire a hierarchical tree of data instead, do the following:

HTML
```html
<q-markdown ref="markdown" :src="markdown" toc @data="onToc" />
```

JavaScript:
```js
methods: {
  onToc (toc) {
    this.toc = this.$refs.markdown.makeTree(toc)
  }
}
```

The TOC data will be transformed to the following:
```
[
  {id: 'h2-Heading', title: 'h2 Heading', level: 2, children: [
    {id: 'h3-Heading', title: 'h3 Heading', level: 3, children: []}
  ]}

]
```

# Importing Vue+Markdown (.vmd)

You are able to mix Vue (SFC: single-file component) and Markdown together. This must be in a file with an extension of `.vmd` (vue+markdown). The markdown can only reside in the `<template>` section of the Vue SFC file.

The minimal viable `.vmd` file must contain a `<template>` section. All other sections are optional.

Example:

```html
<template>
  <div class="q-pa-md q-gutter-sm q-markdown">

QMarkdown is a [Quasar App Extension](https://v1.quasar.dev/app-extensions/introduction). It provides the ability for your web app to display markdown.

# Features
... // the rest of the markdown
</template>
```

As you may have noticed, your HTML code should add the `q-markdown` class to the wrapper html in order to get all proper syntax highlighting.

Now, as far as getting it to be displayed on your page, do the following in your `<script>` section:

```js
import markdownVue from '../markdown/markdown.vmd'

export default {

  components: {
    markdownVue
  },

```

and in your HTML `<template>` section:

```html
<template>
  <markdown-vue />
</template>
```

## TOC with Vue+Markdown

If you would like to generate a TOC (Table of Contents) derived from the header components (h1, h2, h3, etc), you will need to add some code to your `.vmd` file so it can be accepted. Just add the following to your `data ()` instance in the `.vmd`:

```
  data () {
    return {
      // eslint-disable-next-line
      tocData: []
    }
  },
```

The Vue+Markdown (`.vmd`) loader will replace the `tocData: []`, if found, and add the TOC data.

::: warning
Notice the commented line `eslint-disable-next-line`? The data added is not formatted and eslint will complain during compilation time. If you use something other than eslint, you may need to add an appropriate **ignore** statement for your linter.
:::

Finally, if your TOC data is used elsewhere, like the right-drawer in these docs, you need a way of getting it there and if you are using a Vuex store, this is relative easy:

```
  mounted () {
    this.toc = this.tocData
  },

  computed: {
    toc:
    {
      get () {
        return this.$store.state.common.toc
      },
      set (toc) {
        this.$store.commit('common/toc', toc)
      }
    }
  }
```

## Vue+Markdown Issues
So far, a couple of issues have been found.
1. When using `-` over multiple rows for an unorder list, the markdown processor sometimes is not putting in the end `</ul>` tag which causes an issue with Vue transpiling. You can make this an ordered list with `1.` notation.
2. When using text interpolation, better known as moustache or handle bars, the Vue Loader sees these in the markdown and tries to do substitution which will cause Vue Loader to complain that the variable does not exist. You can fix this, by taking the text from the interpolation and use the `v-text="my text"` instead (like a `span` tag).

## Vue+Markdown Comments
Vue+Markdown is experimental. There are a few other authors doing it, like **Vue Press** and **Sable**, as well as the **Quasar Documentation**. However, none of them are using a `.vmd` extension. This was used to distinguish `vue+markdown` from regular markdown. As such, your favorite editor may not have syntax highlighting that works with `.vmd` files. Hopefully, in the future, this will be resolved.

## Front-Matter with Vue+Markdown
Front-Matter is a way of extracting meta data from the beginning of a file and converting it to object format. The format for Front-Matter is in YAML format.

::: tip
All Front-Matter meta data defined in your .vmd file **must** be at the top of the file.
:::

An example of Front-Matter YAML:

```yaml
---
title: QMarkdown Docs
desc: This is the documentation for QMarkdown
---
```

This will be converted to:

```js
{
  title: "QMarkdown Docs",
  desc: "This is the documentation for QMarkdown"
}
```

This is injected into your Vue data by having the following:

```js
  data () {
    return {
      // eslint-disable-next-line
      frontMatter: {}
    }
  },
```

The Vue+Markdown (`.vmd`) loader will replace the `frontMatter: {}`, if found, and add the Front-Matter data.

::: warning
Notice the commented line `eslint-disable-next-line`? The data added is not formatted and eslint will complain during compilation time. If you use something other than eslint, you may need to add an appropriate **ignore** statement for your linter.
:::

Finally, you can use the Front-Matter data like this:

```js
  mounted () {
    document.title = this.frontMatter.title
  },
```

## Importing markdown in a VMD (Vue+Markdown)
Did you know you can also import markdown in a `.vmd` component?

Here is an example of how to do just that:

```html
---
title: Contact us
desc: Our contact details
---

<template>
<div>
  <qm-toc ref="qm-toc" :toc-tree="tocTree"></qm-toc>
  <q-markdown
    :src="markdown"
    toc
    :toc-start="2"
    :toc-end="3"
    @data="onToc"
    ref="markdown"
    class="q-pa-md"
  />
</div>
</template>

<script>
import mdMixin from 'src/md/md-mixin'
import markdown from './contact.md'

export default {
  mixins: [mdMixin],

  data () {
    return {
      // eslint-disable-next-line
      frontMatter: {},
      // eslint-disable-next-line
      tocData: [],

      markdown
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

Notice the mixin used?

Here is the code for that to generate your table of contents:
```html
<template>
  <!-- We display the TOC only if it is not empty (v-if) and the screen is wide
  enough (class: gt-xs). We apply a medium margin: 'q-ma-md' -->
  <q-card
    v-if="tocTree.length"
    class="gt-xs float-right q-ma-md"
    flat
    bordered
  >
    <!-- We use the 'horizontal' to remove paddings -->
    <q-card-section horizontal>
      <!-- We use 'q-expansion-item' to enable toggling (hide/show) the TOC -->
      <q-expansion-item
        default-opened
        icon="toc"
        label="Table of contents"
      >
        <q-separator />
        <q-list>
          <!-- loop through items of tocTree -->
          <template v-for="item in tocTree">
            <!-- if the item does not have children we use 'q-item' -->
            <q-item
              v-if="!item.children.length"
              :key="item.id"
              :to="`#${item.id}`"
            >
              <q-item-section>{{ item.label }}</q-item-section>
            </q-item>
            <!-- if the item has children we use 'q-expansion-item' to enable
            toggling (hiding/showing) them -->
            <q-expansion-item
              v-else
              :key="item.id"
              default-opened
              :label="item.label"
              :to="`#${item.id}`"
            >
              <!-- children are displayed in a q-list below their parent -->
              <q-list>
                <!-- each child is indented a little (inset-level).
                Dense mode uses less space -->
                <q-item
                  v-for="childItem in item.children"
                  :key="childItem.id"
                  dense
                  :inset-level="0.2"
                  :to="`#${childItem.id}`"
                >
                  <q-item-section>{{ childItem.label }}</q-item-section>
                </q-item>
              </q-list>
            </q-expansion-item>
          </template>
        </q-list>
      </q-expansion-item>
    </q-card-section>
  </q-card>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    // 'tocTree' will be provided by the component using QmToc (vmd components)
    tocTree: {
      type: Array,
      default () { return [] }
    }
  }
}
</script>

<style lang="sass">
// When navigating (scrolling) to an anchor and to avoid that the anchor gets
// hidden by the fixed page header we offset the scrolling by the header height.
.q-markdown [class^="q-markdown--heading-h"]
  scroll-margin-top: $toolbar-min-height
</style>
```

# Overriding Links
QMarkdown requires the `Material Design` font for external links. If you wish to override this to avoid the font dependency or provide a different icon, you can override this sass:

```sass
.q-markdown--link-external
  &:after
    content: '\e895'
    font-family: Material Icons
```
To change colors of your links you can do the following:

```sass
.q-markdown--link
  color: blue
  &:hover
    color: green
```

And to change it for dark mode:

```sass
.body--dark
  .q-markdown--link
    color: $green-10
    &:hover
      color: yellow
```

# Anchor Links
An **Anchor Link** is simply a link that points to an element on a page with a corresponding **id**.

To show an achor link on this page, to the **Installation Types** (above), then you must use the slugified verion that matches the id, which in this case is **Installation-Types** (notice the hypen).

You do it in Markdown like this:
```
[Jump to Installation Types](#installation-types)
```

Notice, that for the current page only, you use the hashtag to start. This produces the following (be aware you will jump to **Installation Types** if you click it):

[Jump to Installation Types](#installation-types)

Another type of anchor link automatically generated by QMarkdown is on Headings. To turn it off, use the `no-heading-anchor-links` property. This is also controlled by the `toc-start` and `toc-end` properties to determine which levels of heading will be turned into anchor links.

# Extracting Vue SFC parts
Additionally, QMarkdown comes with a utility function to extract SFC files into their tag parts (where tag is one of `template`, `script` and `style`). To import, do the following:

```js
import { getTagParts } from '@quasar/quasar-ui-qmarkdown'
```

And then, you can use it like this:

```
  mounted () {
    // eslint-disable-next-line import/no-webpack-loader-syntax
    const results = getTagParts(require('!!raw-loader!../components/Hero.vue').default)

    console.log('template', results.template)
    console.log('script', results.script)
    console.log('css', results.css)
  },
```

This makes use of the `raw-loader` Webpack loader. The exclamations (or bang characters) are needed to tell Webpack to override the default loader.

::: tip
`raw-loader` is already loaded via QMarkdown App Extension and you do not need to install it. If you do not install via the App extension, just include `raw-loader` in your `devDependencies`.
:::

Now, you will have access to the tag parts of the Vue file.

# Extending

## Extending Markdown-it!
You can use the `extend` property to extend the Markdown-it! markdown processor. The extend function takes a single argument of the md (markdown) instance.

Now, you can extend QMarkdown with either your own code or Markdown-it! [plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:markdown-it-plugin). Please read the Markdown-It [documentation](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it#readme) on how to do this.

Syntax:

```html
<q-markdown :extend="extendMarkdown" />
```

```js
methods: {
  // to extend links
  extendMarkdown (md) {
    md.renderer.rules.link_open = (tokens, idx, options, env, self) => {
      const token = tokens[idx]

      const hrefIndex = token.attrIndex('href')
      if (token.attrs[hrefIndex][1][0] === '/') {
        token.attrSet('class', 'q-markdown--link q-markdown--link-local')
      } else {
        token.attrSet('class', 'q-markdown--link q-markdown--link-external')
        token.attrSet('target', '_blank')
      }

      return self.renderToken(tokens, idx, options)
    }
  }
}
```

## Extend the Code Highlighting
QMarkdown uses **Prism** for code highlighting. You can use the `extendPrism` property with a function.

Syntax:

```html
<q-markdown :extendPrism="extendPrism" />
```

```js
methods: {
  // to extend Prism
  extendPrism (Prism) {
    // this uses the 'autoloader' plugin
    // https://prismjs.com/plugins/autoloader/
    Prism.plugins.autoloader.languages_path = 'path/to/grammars/'
  }
}
```

However, we have seen issues with this. If all you want to do is add more languages, you can do it easily. `Prism` sets itself up as a global window object. All official language load themselves into `Prism`.

Let's say you want to load the `java` language for `Prism`:
```js
import 'prismjs/components/prism-java'
```
Yep, that's all there is to it. Simple.

# Copy to Clipboard

As of v1.3.0, QMarkdown has the ability to allow your viewers to **Copy to Clipboard**. It all begins with using the `show-copy` property; this turns it all on. When text is copied to the clipboard, a Quasar dialog will be displayed telling end-user it was copied to clipboard. 

::: warning
For the notification to work, add the `Dialog` plugin to your quasar.conf.js
:::

::: tip
If you are showing code blocks, you should turn off line numbers with the `no-line-numbers` property. Leaving line numbers in does not work as you would expect as you'll get a column of numbers and then your content.
:::

Other properties you can use to modify things:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| show-copy | Add behavior that allows end-users to copy content to the clipboard |
| copy-icon | Name of icon from icon font or svg icon to use as the copy icon |
| no-copy-tooltip | Turn off the tooltip associated with the copy icon. |
| copy-tooltip-text | Replacement text for the tooltip. Default: **Copy to Clipboard** |
| copy-response-text | Replacement text for the response. Default: **Copied to Clipboard** |
